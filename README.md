# Project-Proposal-Coursepik
Contains two Jupyter notebooks of descriptive statistics about my proposed project

# Notebook-1 Course Demand
This notebook tends to explore the various categorizes of courses that are popular, which states are have high admission rates


# Notebook-2 Cost Analysis
 This notebook shows the top universities and uncovers myth about "Expensive education" and "Quality"



# Some intriguing results from the analysis: 

1. States with high admission rates may not be the best choice, their courses might not meet industry demands as top schools usually have high bar for admissions. 


2. Education in the top schools may not be the most expensive, top schools offer high academic credibility and their courses align with skills in demand in the industry. 


3. Most popular major is "Business" though STEM skills have higher demand in the industry, thus there is a need for a conscious effort in this direction. 


# Conclusion

The above analysis gives us a picture about what is the current situation and how a recommendation system can solve this high impact problem, the proposed system will not only consider the interest level of the student but also technical factors such as proximity, academic credibility, cost and industry demand of the skills. 

Final Project will have the following input from user and will present out accordingly: 
Input: Location, Academic field interested in 
Output: A list of recommended courses with statistics about each to choose from, industry demand of those skills.
